Just run capture-detect.py to extract all the faces detected with the camera with landmark extraction and extra padding.

** Notes
- This is not the whole system, only the face detection part. The rest is implemented in MAX.
- An earlier version of this project was presented in ESCALATRONICA 2015, Buenos Aires.

** Instalation
- Depends on:
  - OpenCV 2.4
  - Dlib 18.8
  - Python packages: numpy and skimage
- Create a directory ~entities/~ to store the data, or change this in the ~capture-detect.py~ script
- Create a ~data/~ directory and put the ~shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat~ data file from dlib there
